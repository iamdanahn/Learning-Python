* 'print' command writes messages to the console
* '#' are for single line comments
* """ triple " are for multiline comments 

* False statements:
  - 0, 0.0, "" (empty string), [] (empty list), {} (empty object), None


* 'input(_____)' waits for user input. parameter is outputted to user.
```py
  name = input("what is your name? ")
  print(f"hello {name}")
  print("Hello, %s" % name)
```

* +, -, *, /, % - exists
* `**` = exponent
* `//` = integer division (opposite part of %)
 
* if...else statements
  - 'elif' === 'else if' from JS

* 'while' blocks run while true until false. Consists of:
  - 'while' keyword
  - condition (boolean)
  - colon
  - startin on the next line, indented block of code (while clause)

  - 'break' breaks out of the loop
  - 'continue' continues the loop from the top

* 'Pass' keyword, acts like a "white-space" 

* 'NoneType' - absence of a value
JS has 'null' or 'undefined', but Python only has 'None'
