* '#' are for single line comments
* """ triple " are for multiline comments 

* +, -, *, /, % - exists
* `**` = exponent
* `//` = integer division (opposite part of %)
 
* 'while' blocks run while true until false. Consists of:
  - 'while' keyword
  - condition (boolean)
  - colon
  - startin on the next line, indented block of code (while clause)

  - 'break' breaks out of the loop
  - 'continue' continues the loop from the top

* 'NoneType' - absence of a value
JS has 'null' or 'undefined', but Python only has 'None'
